# End-to-End Data Pipeline and Dashboard for E-Commerce Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on building an end-to-end data pipeline and an interactive dashboard for analyzing an e-commerce dataset. The aim was to simulate real-world data engineering and analytical workflows, ultimately delivering actionable insights for an e-commerce business.

The project involves data ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization to showcase key metrics and trends that help understand and optimize business performance.

---

## Objective

To develop a fully functional data pipeline that efficiently processes e-commerce data, stores it in a structured format, and visualizes key metrics on an interactive, user-friendly dashboard.

---

## Dataset

The project utilized an e-commerce dataset containing transactional and customer information.

Example datasets include:

* **Online Retail Dataset**

---

## Features

### 1. **Data Ingestion**

* **Objective:** Efficiently load e-commerce data into a database or storage system.
* **Steps:**
  * Retrieved the dataset from a CSV source.
  * Cleaned and preprocessed the data using Python (`Pandas`).
  * Loaded the cleaned data into a relational database (Mysql).

---

### 2. **Data Transformation**

* **Objective:** Prepare raw data for analysis.
* **Steps:**
  * Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
  * Engineered new metrics such as:
    * **Total Revenue:** `Price Ã— Quantity`
    * **Customer Lifetime Value**
  * Aggregated data into daily, weekly, and monthly summaries for deeper trend analysis.

---

### 3. **Data Storage**

* **Objective:** Store data in a structured and accessible manner.
* **Implementation:**
  * Used **PostgreSQL** for transactional data.
  * Applied indexing to optimize query performance.

---

### 4. **Dashboard Creation**

* **Objective:** Provide a visual representation of e-commerce insights.
* **Implementation:**
  * Built an interactive dashboard using  **Python Dash** .
  * Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
    * **Total Sales**
    * **Number of Transactions**
    * **Average Order Value (AOV)**
    * **Customer Segmentation**
  * Visualizations:
    * Bar charts for product sales.
    * Line charts for trends over time.
    * Pie charts for category-wise contributions.
  * Interactive Filters:
    * Date range
    * Product category
